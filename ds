# ANKU
data structure code
Write a program to create a queue of size N specified by the user. Then you will be given a K value representing the number of elements to be inserted into the queue. After giving K no. of elements you will be given a P value. Then you have to delete the P no. of elements in the queue. After completion of entire process print the element from current starting position to ending position.
